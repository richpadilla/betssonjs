## NetplayTV Testing
There are three tests in this repository, they are designed to be open ended - so be creative!! Good luck.

Note: For the JavaScript tests, please review the *.spec.js files for the API criteria.

### 1 - HTML Test (1 - HTML)
This test is a difference test. The index.html in the file has syntactical errors. We would like you to fix the errors and create a Markdown file explaining the changes made.
Bonus Points: If you are able to suggest performance improvements please do so :-)

### 2 & 3 - JavaScript Tests (Note: you can use a jQuery NPM package if you need)
These tests are to gauge your JavaScript knowledge - there are two tests, you're job is to make the tests pass.

#### Test 1: JS Multiplier 
The aim is to write a simple Multiplier function - it should accept arguments of type Integer only.

#### Test 2: JS String Palindrome 
The aim of this test is to create a function that can check if a string is a Palindrome or not.
